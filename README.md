# Composer Freeze Version

Freeze versions of your composer's dependencies.

This command is especially useful while making a site live. It allows you to grab latest versions of your composer.lock which you tested you site against.
If you would like to go back to a staging status, use another command : [Make Stable](https://github.com/BeAPI/composer-make-stable) to set versions stable.

# What ?

Your dependencies into composer.json will be automatically be changed from :

`"wpackagist-plugin/wordpress-seo":"@stable"`

into :

`"wpackagist-plugin/wordpress-seo":"6.2"`
